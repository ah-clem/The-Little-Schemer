A repo of Scheme code snippets from the book "The Little Schemer", 
4th edition, by Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen.

The inspiration behind learning LISP (and hence purchasing this 
book) was Eric Raymond's widely popular article titled "How To Become 
A Hacker" (http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html), in which
he says,

    "LISP is worth learning for a different reason â€” the profound 
     enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it. 
     That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of 
     your days, even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot".
